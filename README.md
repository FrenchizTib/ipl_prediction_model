**This model was created as part of Project Week for the Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp**

The model makes a prediction as to whether a team will win an Indian Premier League cricket match. 

We chose an xgboost model for the binary classification task. When trained the model predicted successfully with an accuracy of 64%.
